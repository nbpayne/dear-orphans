<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Here's a quick update on what's happening for us.</p>
<p>On Friday February 11 we're playing our first ever gig down in the Illawarra. We'll be playing at the Heritage Hotel in Bulli supporting our good friend Jackie Dee.</p>
<p>Jackie's been making an impact in the country scene with her debut EP tide and she'll be appearing with her band. We're heading down with Mike Kirkley on Pedal Steel and Lindsay Mar on double bass. Opening the night will be Laurie Whitby.</p>
<p>The Heritage Hotel is a great roots venue and we're looking forward to playing there.</p>
