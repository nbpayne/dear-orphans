## I spent a weekend in Bellingen with Scott Collins and helped him finish off this song. It's a gospel song he wrote on the bus on the way back from the Pittwater Bluegrass Jam.

<p>I'm looking forward to him finishing his album and releasing it, but in the meantime have a listen to this sneak preview of his work.</p>
<p>I contributed a few verses, hand claps, foot taps and lots of yelling and screaming and singing out of tune in the background.</p>
