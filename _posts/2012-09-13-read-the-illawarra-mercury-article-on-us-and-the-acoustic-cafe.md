<h2>Acoustic Cafe Sessions</h2>
<h3>An intimate setting with dim lights, cafe tables, bean bags, candles, wall art installations, a fully licensed bar, coffees and cakes... just add music.</h3>
<p>These are the ingredients that make for Wollongong Town Hall&rsquo;s first Acoustic Cafe.</p>
<p>An idea born from discussion between town hall centre manager Claire Roberts and musician Mem Davis, the Acoustic Cafe will come to life on Saturday, September 15.</p>
<p>The Acoustic Cafe will transform the multi-purpose room of the town hall into a space to showcase musicians and local artists.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em; font-style: italic; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em;">&ldquo;We like playing in rooms and environments where everyone&rsquo;s together</p>
<p>The first gig will feature Sydney act Dear Orphans and locals Rebecca Moore and Mem Davis &amp; The Kindred Spirits.</p>
<p>Dear Orphans&rsquo; Lyn Taylor and Nick Payne say they are looking forward to performing at the Acoustic Cafe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We like playing in rooms and environments where everyone&rsquo;s together,&rdquo; Payne says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can have a conversation with the audience and talk to people in the front rows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that way they&rsquo;re more likely to listen,&rdquo; Taylor adds with a laugh.</p>
<p>The Sydney songwriting couple teams up with three others to deliver a blend of bluegrass that, as Nick describes it, is about &ldquo;cowboys and road trips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Lyn writes the love songs and sad songs,&rdquo; he adds.</p>
<p>Payne, a former Woonona lad, agrees that intimate acoustic settings are far and few between in the Illawarra.</p>
<p>Depending on the turn-out to this gig, more Acoustic Cafe performances may be held.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wollongong has many musicians, it&rsquo;s great to create space for acoustic music,&rdquo; Roberts, a musician herself, says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are fortunate to have some wonderful musicians and artists in the Illawarra and this is the ideal venue to combine both concepts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The line-up of music offers great variety, from the bluegrass of Dear Orphans, to Rebecca Moore&rsquo;s ancient folk music traditions combined with powerful rock instrumentation and Mem Davis&rsquo; sounds of alt-country, folk, blues, bluegrass and indie.</p>
<p>A portion of the proceeds from the Acoustic Cafe event will be donated to Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia, which offers care for women who suffer obstetric fistula, caused by prolonged obstructed labour.</p>
<p>These women also endure shame and marginalisation as a result of their condition.</p>
<p>Roberts says the plan is for different local and overseas acts to gain from future performances at the Acoustic Cafe.</p>
