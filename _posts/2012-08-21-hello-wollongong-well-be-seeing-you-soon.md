## We're looking forward to visiting Wollongong on Saturday 15th September to join local artists Rebecca Moore and Mem Davis &amp; The Kindred Spirits to play a show in support of the work of Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia.

<p style="font-size: 1.5em; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">A fistula is the most devestating of childbirth injuries.</p>

<p>An obstetric fistula develops when the blood supply to the tissues of the vagina and bladder (and/or rectum) is cut off during prolonged, obstructed labour. The tissues die and a hole forms through which urine and/or faeces pass uncontrollably. Women who develop fistulae are often abandoned by their husbands, rejected by their communities and forced to live an isolated existence.</p>
<p>Obsteric fistulae have been eliminated in the first world with the advent of the caesarean section, but still affect women living in third world countries.</p>
<p>The surgical technique developed by Australian Dr Catherine Hamlin and her late husband Dr Reginald Hamlin, a New Zealander, successfully cures 93% of obstetric fistula cases. The Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital and its regional Hamlin Fistula Centres offer comprehensive care for women who suffer from incontinence, physical impairment, shame and marginalisation as a result obstetric fistula.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em; font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em;">OK that was the serious bit. The fun bit is that we are going to do something about it.</p>
<p>Mem Davis has worked with the folk at Wollongong Town Hall to organise a show were we can make some noise and donate part of the proceeds towards the work of Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia.&nbsp;They'll be converting one of the rooms to an acoustic music theme with cafe tables, dim lighting, wall art instillations, an intimate vibe and access to a full bar/caf&eacute;. We get to headline the show with some awesome support provided by Mem and our friend Rebecca Moore.</p>
<p>There's already a heap of interest being shown in this gig so we suggest getting in early and purchasing tickets from the Wollongong Town Hall box office or online.</p>
