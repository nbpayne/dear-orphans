## Due to circumstances beyond our control, tomorrow night's gig at The Vanguard has been postponed for approximately 4-6 weeks. We'll know the new date by the end of next week and will let you all know as soon as we do.

<p>To prevent disappointment for those who were hanging out to see us play, we are instead playing a house concert tomorrow night. It'll be from 6.30pm at a location in the Eastern Suburbs. There are limited places, so if you want to come along you'll need to email us at <a href="mailto:houseconcert@dearorphans.com">houseconcert@dearorphans.com</a>. We'll respond to let you know the address or we'll apologise profusely that we've run out of room.</p>
<p>Drop us an email if you've got anymore questions and please accept our apologies for the change of plans.</p>
<p>Nick</p>
