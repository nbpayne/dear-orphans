## We've been working on new songs and we gave this new one from Lyn a run at our most recent Orphanage Session.

<p>Lyn is so excited about it that she grabbed her iPhone and video-ed herself singing it at home. I think it turned out pretty well and we present it here for your viewing pleasure.</p>
<p>We'd love to hear what you think.</p>
