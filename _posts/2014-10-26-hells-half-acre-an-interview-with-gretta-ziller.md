## In a few weeks we return to one of our musical homes at <em>Mars Hill Cafe</em> in Parramatta for a one-off <em>Orphanage Session</em>. In anticipation I asked our feature guest <em>Gretta Ziller</em> some questions.

<p><strong>NP: How does the songwriting process work for you - where do you find your inspiration and what steps does a song go through in order to be written?</strong></p>
<p>GZ: I&rsquo;m a bit of a bowerbird when it comes to writing, I&rsquo;ll collect ideas, titles &amp; lyrics from here there and everywhere, it comes from conversations or books I read or movies or music, I do have a few tv shows that I watch often for inspiration!  Then when I have the time i&rsquo;ll sit down and sift through my little bundles and see what happens!</p>
<p><strong>NP: Tell us about Hell&rsquo;s Half Acre - where is it and what is it about it that inspired you to write a song?</strong></p>
<p>GZ: Hell&rsquo;s Half Acre was inspired by a trip to Canada, we went to a bad lands (Drumheller) it was an amazing place, a big desert like hole in the ground! I wanted to put the idea of the place into a song but Drumheller just didn&rsquo;t work as a title!!! The power of google and I found Hell&rsquo;s Half Acre in Wyoming! It&rsquo;s a pretty cool place, they&rsquo;ve used it for films and photography!</p>
<p><strong>NP: What was your journey to becoming a songwriter - what happened that made you want to try your hand at it and what was it that made you commit yourself to it and work at it?</strong></p>
<p>GZ: Songwriting was something that I had dabbled at for a few years, I didn&rsquo;t have the confidence to share my songs for quite a while. I had done a few songwriting workshops and even classes though Berklee College Online. It wasn&rsquo;t until I attended the CMAA College of Country Music that things kind of clicked, I got some great feedback from the songwriters in residence and met other musos in my position, it was a really defining and liberating experience for me!</p>
<p><strong>NP: Tell us about a time you heard some music for the first time that changed you in some way.</strong></p>
<p>GZ: I grew up surrounded by music, my mother was a great music appreciator, we listened to everything from Pavarotti to Edith Piaf to Aretha Franklin and Sarah Vaughn and top 40 music. The one genre that wasn&rsquo;t in our playlist was country music. I was in my final year of University studying a Bachelor of Music, training to be a classical singer, when I &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; Garth Brooks Double Live from my sister, unless you&rsquo;ve experienced a moment like I had it&rsquo;s really hard to explain it, something clicked within me and I just new what I wanted to sing. My tastes have evolved since then, but I still have those kind of moments when I here amazing songs, and I think that&rsquo;s what music is all about, creating something that touches people.</p>
<p><strong>NP: If you could share the stage with anyone (alive or passed on) and sing a duet who would it be and what song would you sing?</strong></p>
<p>GZ: This question is easy, Jim Lauderdale, every time I listen to him sing I learn something, the way he phrases his lyric, how he places the words in the melody it&rsquo;s awesome&hellip;. Jim Lauderdale is awesome!! In saying that if he was busy that week, I wouldn&rsquo;t complain about singing with Steve Earle!!</p>
