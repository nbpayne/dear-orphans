## Hi everyone! We don't play in the inner city of Sydney that often and people often ask when we're going to. Well the wait is over!

<p class="text-center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2012/6/slh-stage.JPG" alt="Sydney Livehouse stage" /></p>

<p>On Thursday June 28 we're playing a show at Sydney Livehouse (AKA the Lewisham Hotel) with our friend Chrissie Pearce and friends of hers called Redruth. It's a mere $10 to get in and you can be sure of hearing some great music (I get to play harmonica with Chrissie on a couple of numbers - Nick).</p>
<p>The folks at Sydney Livehouse are serious about music and they've spruced the placed up to look nice and also put in a new PA and an awesome lighting rig. We're looking forward to this opportunity to play a little closer to home and hope you'll join us for a great night.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25em;"><strong>Redruth + Dear Orphans + Chrissie Pearce @ Sydney Livehouse</strong><br />8pm Thursday June 28<br />The Lewisham Hotel<br />794 Parramatta Road<br />Lewisham NSW 2049<br />(Cnr Parramatta Road &amp; Old Canterbury Road)</p>
