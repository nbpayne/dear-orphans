## Winter has definitely arrived in dear little Sydney and whilst most of us are keeping warm by a fire (or a big heater) we&rsquo;re keeping warm by rehearsing (and a big heater) for our next Orphanage Session.

Joining us this time around will be our dear friend *Karl Broadie*. I first met Karl through a mutual friend several years ago. This friend of mine was having lunch with Karl and some friends and knowing that Lyn and I were starting to put together a band invited me along. At a pre-determined time she said, &ldquo;Karl - Nick is in a band&rdquo;, and the conversation began.


In that first conversation Karl offered me sage advice and encouragement and after that we bumped into him regularly. When we started The Orphanage Sessions in 2008 Karl was on the top of our list of guests to ask to play - he gladly accepted. In 2009 we asked Karl to produce our debut album. He guided us through process of recording it in his lounge room, providing invaluable technical and creative input. The results were spectacular.

Karl is an amazing, empathetic songwriter which is reflected by the fact we&rsquo;ve always had a great turnout whenever he&rsquo;s played at an Orphanage Session. In fact, I&rsquo;d say that the sessions are one of the best places to see someone like Karl play.

> Great gigs are a combination of the performance of the artist, the enthusiasm of an audience and the intimacy of the space that brings them together.

And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re looking forward on Saturday July 9 for our next session. Prior to that we&rsquo;re also joining Karl as his guest at his Showcase Collection at the Bald Rock Hotel in Rozelle.
