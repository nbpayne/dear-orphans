## It never rains it pours.

### On Saturday we load the car up and head to Tamworth Country Music Festival for a few days. Paul and Carlyn are coming with us and we're looking forward to playing a couple of shows, listening to some great music and catching up with old friends.

<p>If you're going to be in Tamworth for the festival then there's something crazy we'd like to try. I'm calling it "house-busking" and it works something like this.</p>
<p>Invite a few people round to where you're staying, put on a meal for everyone and we'll show up at your request to play some songs and shoot the breeze with you and your friends. It's kind of like a house concert, it's kind of like busking, but at your place.</p>
<p>Interested? Pop us an email at <a class="external" href="mailto:tamworth@dearorphans.com">tamworth@dearorphans.com</a> and we'll set it up. (Note that we're available from around 6pm Saturday 19th through to early afternoon Monday 21st).</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25em;"><strong>Sunday 20th, 1pm</strong><br />Tamworth Songwriters Association Showcase<br />The Outback Bar West Tamworth Leagues Club<br />Phillip Street, West Tamworth<br />Lyn and I are on stage about 4.30pm to play a short set</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25em;"><strong>Monday 21st, 10am</strong><br />Post Office Hotel<br />8 Fitzroy St, Tamworth<br />Full band show to kick your morning off</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25em;"><strong>Saturday 19th, 6pm onwards<br /></strong>Busking on Corner Peel and Brisbane Streets<strong><br />&nbsp;</strong></p>

### The Newsagency with Susanna Carman

<p>For those back in Sydney Lyn and I will be opening for our friend Susanna Carman at The Newsagency in Marrickville on Thursday 31st January. Susanna plays an amazing one-woman show and The Newsagency is a fantastic new, intimate venue. This show is highly recommended and we suggest buying tickets before the show as numbers are limited.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25em;"><strong>Thursday 31st, 8.30pm</strong><br />Susanna Carmen + Dear Orphans<br />The Newsagency<br />375 Enmore Road, Marrickville<br />Tickets: <a class="external" href="http://www.stickytickets.com.au/10082" target="_blank">www.stickytickets.com.au/10082</a></p>
<h3>Death Do Us Part</h3>
<p>To finish off here is a clip of us playing Death Do Us Part from the Old Manly Boatshed last year. Many thanks to Keith Armitage of Songwriters Live for shooting this.</p>
