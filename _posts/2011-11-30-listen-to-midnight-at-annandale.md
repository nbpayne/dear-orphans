<p>Following on from their debut album <em>Dear Orphans</em>, alt-country songwriters Lyn Taylor and Nick Payne return with a new EP inspired by the local, Sydney bluegrass and old time music community - the Bluegrass and Traditional Country Music Society.</p>
<p>Nick writes:</p>

> "These folk meet the first Saturday of the month at the Annandale Neighbourhood Centre for an open mic night and lots of jamming. They are passionate players of bluegrass and old timey music including beginners through to some of Australia's best bluegrass musicians. The amazing thing about these folk is that you've never heard of them. And you may never hear of them either. Their passion for the music is such that they'd rather stand in a corridor and jam with you than play to a thousand people. And they are some of the most welcoming people you'll ever meet who are always ready to teach you a lick or two on your guitar, banjo, mandolin or whatever you might be holding."

<p style="font-size: 1.5em; font-style: italic; margin-left: 10ex; margin-right: 10ex;">Inspired by these musicians and their music Dear Orphans have come up with six new recordings that capture the soul of this heritage in both instrumentation and message.</p>
<p>Joining them on instrument are musicians from this community including Richard Galluzzi on clawhammer banjo, Carlyn Chen on fiddle and Elen Price on double bass. Also featuring are their old friend Mike Kirkley on pedal steel and jazz singer Paul Sun takes to the double bass and now features as a permanent part of their live act.</p>
<p>If you enjoy music that draws from a deep well of music from the first part of the last century and combines it with a contemporary songwriting attitude, then listen below to these tracks from the always fresh Dear Orphans.</p>

<h4>An Orphan's Life</h4>
<p>A haunting gospel song longing for a new home. A 1930's country/gospel feel with solos from Richards clawhammer banjo and Nick on dobro. All the while with Scott Collins playing lonesome harmonica in the background. Overlaid across all of this is the duet vocals of Lyn and Nick playing the part of an orphan wishing for an eternal family.</p>
<h4>Weary</h4>
<p>A drunk song penned by Lyn and featuring Nick on lead vocals. The last song you play in a late night jam before you roll into bed at 3am.</p>
<h4>Sean Connery is Bond</h4>
<p>A classic bluegrass "tune" (or instrumental) featuring solos from Nick and Richard on dobro and clawhammer banjo respectively. Just when you think the song is over the melodic sounds of Mike Kirkley on pedal steel take over, lifting this song to be something a little bit more than what you'd expect from a bluegrass tune.</p>
<h4>Sunset Dreaming</h4>
<p>The gentle vocals and sparse guitar finger-picking of Lyn Taylor dominate this song with the subtle slide sounds of Mike Kirkley on pedal steel. Double bass savante Elsen Price adds an intriguing layer to this song as he bows the bass line from the middle of the song onwards. A brief ukulele solo from Nick takes us to the end.</p>
<h4>Wait the Night</h4>
<p>The first Dear Orphans track to be penned by banjo player Richard Galluzzi. An simple and innocent song that hopes that a lover (or friend?) might stay a little longer before going home. Old time music meets contemporary message.</p>
<h4>Castlereagh</h4>
<p>The second track penned by Richard Galluzzi. An authentic old time tune showcasing the clawhammer banjo and Carlyn Chen's amazing fiddle playing. Recorded entirely live in a single take in Nick and Lyn's lounge room. Features Lyn on hand claps, whoops and hollers.</p>
