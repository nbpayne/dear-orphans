## After a relaxing break for a few months The Orphanage Sessions are back with a few changes.

Firstly, our first Orphanage Session for 2010 will feature not 1, but 2 guest artists! On Saturday April 10 you will not only get your regular dose of Dear Orphans, but you will also get a short set to open from new talent, Jackie Dee and headlining the night is Benn Gunn.

BENN GUNN is a 2008 Toyota Star Maker Finalist and a 2009 Australian College of Country Music Graduate. As a small boy he taught himself to play guitar right handed simply because he could not find a left handed guitar. Having always been moved by strong soulful voices his inspiration as a singer comes from artists such as Otis Redding, Robert Plant, John Foggerty and Travis Tritt.

<p>JACKIE DEE represents some of the best new talent coming up in the country/folk scene. Hailing from the South Coast she's just headed into the studio with Matt Fell of Love Hz studios to record her debut EP. Her debut at The Orphanage Sessions will be her first gig after her recording sessions and we expect her to be brimming with creative energy.</p>
<p>As always you can expect one of the most intimate venues in Sydney with top quality sound, ethical Brazilian coffee (ask for a "Mohawk" if your'e brave) and heaps of comfy seating on lounges and at tables.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Because we're adding a third artist to the line up at the next session, we'll be starting earlier at 7.30pm.</p>
