## It's been while since our debut album "Dear Orphans" was released so this September we've been planning and plotting a new release.

<p>Over the next few weeks we'll be recording some new material for a release. We're pretty excited about it so we thought we'd answer a few questions you might be asking about it.</p>
<h4>Why now?</h4>
<p>Firstly, it's been too long since we released our first album Dear Orphans. After a hectic 2008 and 2009 we put our feet up in 2010 because we were burnt out from the effort of keeping the Orphanage Sessions going every month. At the start of this year we vowed to record something new and although the year has gotten away from us we're now coming good on that promise.</p>
<p>Secondly, the band we've got playing with us right now is sounding the best we've ever had a band sounding. We're feeling very blessed to have the privilege of playing with our current line up and we really want to capture the sound that is happening right now.</p>
<h4>Is this an album or an EP?</h4>
<p>The release will have enough material on it to make it more than an EP, but it'll be a little shorter than a full length album. Maybe it's a mini-album.</p>
<h4>What's the style of this album?</h4>
<p>Our current line up includes Paul Sun on double bass, Richard Galluzzi on clawhammer banjo and Carlyn Chen on fiddle. As a result this will be a very bluegrass sounding album. There'll be some tracks that we've recorded earlier this year that feature Mike Kirkley on pedal steel, Linday Mar on double bass and also Elsen Price on double bass.</p>
<h4>When will it be available?</h4>
<p>At our next Orphanage Session on November 12. Sara Tindley will be our guest and she's great.</p>
<h4>What next after this?</h4>
<p>We've got a bunch of songs we're saving for an album following this. It's tentatively themed "Cowboy and Road Songs" and Lyn's keen to make a noise on the electric guitar. Expect this release to be a bit edgier when it arrives.</p>
<h4>How can we keep up to date with what's happening?</h4>
<p>We'll be recording over the next few weekends and we'll be posting photos and stuff on Facebook. You can keep an eye on what's happening at <a class="external" href="http://www.facebook.com/dearorphans">www.facebook.com/dearorphans</a>.</p>
<h4>Can we have a sneak preview of any of the songs?</h4>
<p>You sure can. Here's something that we've been working on. It's a bit different... it's an instrumental.</p>
