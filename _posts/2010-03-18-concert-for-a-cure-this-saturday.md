<p>There's been some changes in the schedule and we're now on stage at 2.50pm. If you were planning on only coming for part of the day, make sure you adjust your plans appropriately!</p>
<p>Also, we're looking forward to having Richard Galluzzi join us on clawhammer banjo as well as Lindsay Mar on upright bass. We've worked up a new number which is an instrumental that showcases Richard's impressive banjo playing and my more than adequate dobro playing.</p>
<p>Just a reminder of the time and place... and check out the Gigs page and the Concert for a Cure website at the links below.</p>
