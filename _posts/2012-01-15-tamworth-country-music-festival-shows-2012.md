## Hi everyone.&nbsp;Just a quick reminder we are playing two shows at the Tamworth Country Music Festival next week.

<p>The shows are on the first Friday and Saturday of the festival and are both free outdoor shows on the streets of Tamworth. However, the most exciting thing is that the whole band will be joining us.</p>
<p>This will be the first time in Tamworth for our banjo player Richard Galluzzi, fiddle player Carlyn Chen and double bassist Paul Sun. Paul is even bringing his whole family with him to share the experience!</p>
<p>We hope to see you on the streets on Tamworth next week! Be sure to say hi.</p>
<p>Nick and Lyn.</p>
