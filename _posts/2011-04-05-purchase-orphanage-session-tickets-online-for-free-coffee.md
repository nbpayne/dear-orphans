## We've been rehearsing hard and are starting to get excited about the upcoming Orphanage Session on Saturday April 16.

<p>Because of this we've decided to thank those who pre-purchase tickets with a free treat. Buy your tickets for The Orphanage Session through OzTix and we'll throw in your choice of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A free mug-sized hot beverage courtesy of the friendly folk at Mars Hill (remember the coffee is Brazilian and ethical), or,</li>
<li>A free set of our stylish Dear Orphans badges - just the thing to make you look hip and happening.</li>
</ul>
<div>This offer also applies to those who've already pre-purchased tickets via OzTix. Just turn up on the night and we'll sort it out.</div>
<p>To pre-purchase tickets for The Orphanage Session go to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oztix.com.au" target="_blank">www.oztix.com.au</a>&nbsp;or any OzTix outlets. Or click the big, blue button.</p>
