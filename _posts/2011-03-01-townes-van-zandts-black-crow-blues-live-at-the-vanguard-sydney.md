## Last year Lyn and I had the priviledge of playing at The Vanguard in Sydney. We were lucky enough to be able to video the whole gig and we present one of our tracks for your listening pleasure.

<p>This is Townes Van Zandt's "Black Crow Blues" - we've got a version of this song on our album, which we recorded straight to stereo and then overdubbed a single harmonica part. Here we try to reproduce what we played live on the album live on stage.</p>
