<h3>It's exciting haven written a new song. All you want to do is to send it out into the world as soon as you can.</h3>
<p>I recently wrote this song with <em>Katie Brianna</em> for inclusion on my upcoming solo album. Having written it I wanted to record a "demo" of it so we could listen back to it objectively and hone the song further. At the same time it seemed like a good idea to video what was happening for posterity.</p>
<p>Once I listened back to what we'd created I thought that others might enjoy an early sneak peek at what to expect from my album. So here it is.</p>
<p>Nick</p>
<p>To find out more about the album and catch up on progress, please read my previous blogs.</p>
