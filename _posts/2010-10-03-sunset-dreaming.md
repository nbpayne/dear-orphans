## Here's a little something we recorded earlier in the year that we haven't done anything with.

<p>We recorded this at home and it features Lyn on guitar and vocals, Mike Kirkley on Pedal Steel, Elsen Price on double bass (and seagull noises), and I got to break out the Martin uke for a solo.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy. We'll share some more soon.</p>
