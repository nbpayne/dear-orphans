## In the lead up to our Melbourne trip we shot a couple of videos expressing our excitement about the visit.

<p>When the time came for the trip we decided we should make a third video for posterity. The thought of lugging all our camera gear, however, was more than we could bear. So instead we decided to document the trip with a series of 15 second Instagram videos and on our return to edit those together into a single two and half minute video clip.</p>
<p>We proudly present it here for your viewing.</p>
