<p>Castlereagh is a suburb on the outskirts of Sydney Australia. It is one of five towns officially proclaimed by governor Lachlan Macquarie on December 6, 1810. He named it after the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Viscount Castlereagh. He in turn was named after Castlereagh in Ireland.</p>
<p>This song was written by our clawhammer banjo player Richard Galluzzi who frequently rides his bicycle through the bushland at Castlereagh. The track features Richard on clawhammer banjo, Carlyn Chen on fiddle, Nick Payne on acoustic guitar, Paul Sun on double bass and Lyn Taylor on hollers and hand claps.</p>
<p>This is the first video clip we've made and we're pretty chuffed that it's come out looking so great. Please share this with others if you enjoy it!</p>
