## You may have noticed that things have been pretty quiet on the Dear Orphans front for a few months. The reason for this is we've been busily working away behind the scenes setting up some pretty important things for us.

<h3>Dear Orphans sign to independent label Blue Pie</h3>
<p>At the start of April Lyn and I signed with local independent record label Blue Pie Productions. Over the last few months we've been working with the crew at Blue Pie to get a whole lot of things organised like publishing and distribution - all those boring, but important things that need to happen to keep things ticking along.</p>
<p>We're very excited about working with Blue Pie and are looking forward to worrying less about organising things and instead spending more time writing and playing music.</p>
<h3>Dear Orphans + Indigo Belle + Jennifer Concannon at The Vanguard in Sydney</h3>
<p>One outcome from all of the above is that we are headlining a gig at The Vanguard on Sunday July 25.&nbsp;Playing with us will be Indigo Belle and Jennifer Concannon.</p>
<p>Indigo Belle are made up of Pat O'Donnel and Kellie Walker. We met these guys at the Tamworth Country Music Festival in 2009 and are looking forward to sharing the stage with them. The Vanguard is one of Sydney's premier blues and roots venues and it's a honour to have been asked to headline a show for them.</p>
<p>Joining us on stage will be the full band with the ever faithful Mike Kirkley on Pedal Steel, Richard Galuzzi on Clawhammer Banjo and Lindsay Mar on double bass.</p>
<p>Full details are as follows:</p>
<p>Dear Orphans + Indigo Belle + Jennifer Concannon<br />The Vanguard<br />42 King Street<br />Newtown NSW</p>
