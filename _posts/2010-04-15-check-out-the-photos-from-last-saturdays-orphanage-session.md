<p>There's some great photos of Jackie's set and then some good ones of our set too. We're pleased that there's a some awesome shots of Mike and Richard in action on their respective instruments. If you look really carefully you'll see a couple of glimpses of Lindsay in the background. Sorry Lindsay! We'll have to make sure we get some good ones of you next time. Unfortunately we don't have any of Benn because our photographer had to&nbsp;leave, but if anyone does have any then please post them to our Facebook fan page so we can have a look.</p>
<p>You can find the photos on our Facebook fan page at the following address. Please become a fan whilst you're there, if you're not already.</p>
