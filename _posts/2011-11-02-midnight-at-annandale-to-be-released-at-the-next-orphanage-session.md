<p>We've been super busy the last month or so finalising our new EP "Midnight at Annandale". The EP is inspired by an amazing group of Australia's most selfless musicians - the welcoming folk at Sydney's Bluegrass and Traditional Country Music Society.</p>
<p>These folk meet the first Saturday of the month at the Annandale Neighbourhood Centre for an open mic night and lots of jamming. They are passionate players of bluegrass and old timey music including beginners through to some of Australia's best bluegrass musicians. The amazing thing about these folk is that you've never heard of them. And you may never hear of them either. Their passion for the music is such that they'd rather stand in a corridoor and jam with you than play to a thousand people. And they are some of the most welcoming people you'll ever meet who are alway ready to teach you a lick or two on your guitar, banjo, mandolin or whatever you might be holding.</p>
<p>This new EP is inspired by both these people and their music. And we've be blessed to have some of them play on it including Richard Galluzzi on clawhammer banjo, Carlyn Chen on fiddle and Lindsay Mar on double bass. Add to the mix our old friend Mike Kirkley on pedal steel, Elsen Price on double bass as well as Paul Sun on double bass (he also sings jazz - see <a class="external" href="http://www.swingingoodtime.com/" target="_blank">www.swingingoodtime.com</a>). Two of the tracks were written by our banjo player Richard.</p>
<p>We are releasing this EP Saturday November 12 at our last Orphanage Session for 2011 as a digital download. It will be available on the night for sale and you will be able to download it as soon as you get home to your computer, iPod and burn it to CD to play in the car. It will be available for sale on our website sometime during the following the week.</p>

<h3>Sara Tindley</h3>

<p>Joining us at The Orphanage Session will be our feature guest Sara Tindley. Sara comes from Byron Bay with a new album under her belt - <em>Time</em>&nbsp;- produced by Chris Parkinson from The Yearlings (who were our guests way back in 2008). Her previous album was produced by Bill Chambers and she's amazing! We can't wait to welcome her.</p>
<p class="blockquote">"Lyrically, Tindley shows shades of Paul Kelly &amp; Tim Rogers while sticking to a Lucinda Williams-esque sound that's about as sweet as anything that's come out of the country for quite some time&hellip; compulsory listening for all supporters of Australian roots music" &ndash; Dan Condon, Time Off</p>
