## We're super excited to announce that Sydney bluegrass community legends the <em>Stomp Kats</em> will be our feature guest at our first Orphanage Session for 2012.

<p>We've been busy since November playing at the Tamworth Country Music Festival, rehearsing heaps, writing new songs, and the list goes on. So we're looking forward to getting back to Mars Hill Cafe and playing in one of our favourite ever spaces. We're particularly excited to have the Stomp Kats as our feature guests, because we've admired them for a very long time and we love what they do.</p>
<p>The Stomp Kats, Holstein (aka Steve Vassallo) and Bo'Weavil (aka Marcel Chaloupka) play the real deal, old-style pre-war old time bluegrass. They are reminiscent of the sounds of rural America sometime between the 19th and early 20th century, with their hard'n fast bluegrass gutbucket rhythms and high lonesome harmonies that take you on a journey when life was a little simpler.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em; font-style: italic; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em;">Old school harmonies, raw acoustic interplay and driving rhythms reminiscent of twangin' country and Delta blues just like the good ol' days.</p>
<p>We recorded these guys at Harrietville Bluegrass Convention last November in our hotel room. Two guys, one guitar, one mandolin and one microphone - the result sounds amazing. Joining them on stage this time round will be Mark Ballesi on dobro and our own Richard Galluzzi on clawhammer banjo.</p>
<p>Have a listen to this recording of Holstein and Bo'Weavil, helped out by Jenny Shimmin on bluegrass banjo, from our hotel room in Harrietville.</p>
