## After having to postpone our recent gig at The Vanguard with Indigo Belle, we now have a new date - Sunday August 29. This is just over a week away so please lock this in your diary now and book tickets straight away.

<p class="right" style="margin: 0 0 1em 1em;"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-style: initial; border-color: initial; " src="/images/2010/8/BPP-Dear-Orphans-Comp-Card-05.jpeg" alt="Dear Orphans" /></p>

<p>This is going to be a great night with Indigo Belle playing support followed by ourselves with the whole band including Mike Kirkley on pedal steel, Richard Galuzzi on clawhammer banjo and Lindsay Mar on double bass.</p>
<p>Doors open at 6.30pm for those dining and music will start from around 8pm onwards.</p>
<p>We strongly encourage everyone to pre-book tickets in advance via The Vanguards website. We also encourage you to consider coming for a meal.</p>
<p>This venue, like many others, survives on punters who come for a meal as well as the show so booking a dinner and show ticket now is a positive way to support live music. Pre-booking tickets also gives the venue confidence that a viable crowd will attend on the night. Our previous show was postponed because the venue was concerned about a lack of pre-sales, so booking now will be a great help for us to be able to put this show on.</p>
