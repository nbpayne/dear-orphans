## We've been hibernating away and working on a new video clip.

<p>The clip is for the song <em>Castlereagh</em> off our current EP - Midnight at Annandale. It was written by our clawhammer banjo player Richard Galluzzi and features the lofty fiddle playing of Carlyn Chen alongside Richard's banjo.</p>
<p>The footage for this clip was shot entirely at Dorrigo Folk and Bluegrass Festival in October last year. Dorrigo is one of our favourite festivals and the song matches the vibe of this great festival perfectly!</p>
<p>Here's a bunch of stills from the clip as a sneak preview of what to expect very soon.</p>
<p>Enjoy. Nick and Lyn.</p>
