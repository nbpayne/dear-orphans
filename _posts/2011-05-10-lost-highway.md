## A man gets in his car and drives off into the sunset leaving behind a failed relationship. Is he heading towards a new start or something else?

<p>This song started off after listening to Townes Van Zandt for about a week. Playing on Capo 3 it uses a pretty common Am, Dm, E7 progression for the verse. The chorus then uses the major equivalents - C, F and G.</p>
<p>After writing this song I was bugged by a feeling that I'd inadvertantly lifted the melody from another song. After a couple of hours flicking through CDs I found not one, but two songs that used the melody - <em>Wayfaring Stranger</em> and Kasey Chamber's <em>I Still Pray</em>. A little fiddling with the melody and I was able to change it enough to give it its own unique voice, yet still retain the ethos of the aforementioned tracks. I completely forgot about the link to <em>I Still Pray</em>&nbsp;until one day when Jess Chalker told me it reminded her of that song.</p>

<p class="text-center">Sun comes up across the burning plain<br />As yesterday slowly fades away<br />The night is gone day is almost here<br />I'll leave that girl way behind<br />Heading down the road don't know what I'll find<br />I'm heading down that lost highway</p>
<p class="text-center">Gonna leave those days behind me<br />Gonna live from day to day<br />Gonna ride off into glory<br />As I travel the lost highway</p>
<p class="text-center">Gonna right a note to leave behind<br />All about my life what I did find<br />About my life and the way it ran<br />Its time say my last goodbyes<br />Heading down the road towards the light<br />I'm heading down the lost highway</p>
<p class="text-center">Darling don't you know<br />You don't have to be<br />All alone in this life<br />You're someone to me</p>
